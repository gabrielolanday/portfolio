        <h1>gabriel olanday.</h1>
        <p> Gabriel is a senior studying Integrated Digital Media
         at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. He has had a passion for photo
         realistic computer generated images, or CGI, since he was very young.
         Though very much still a beginner, he continues to learn and perfect
         this craft everyday.

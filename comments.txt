brand identity - lowercase, periods, be consistent
*probably lowercase in the titles only

HOME
- alternating alignment might feel like more of an alignment issue than a stylistic choice

NAVBAR
- space between
- indicator for where u are in the site
- put nav tag at the bottom of html so it clips OVER the other content

ABOUT
- lowercase, just "gabriel." like on the title (maybe "gabriel olanday." ?)
- shrink the div, make the text not take the whole page

responsive layout LOLOLOL we gon see if i can finesse this one
